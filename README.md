- **Dynamic Permissions**: Assign or modify permissions for roles. Permissions can be displayed clearly for ease of modification.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is responsive and adapts seamlessly to different devices, ensuring a smooth experience across platforms.
- **Custom API Simulation (Optional)**: Mock API calls for CRUD operations on users and roles, simulating server responses for validation.
